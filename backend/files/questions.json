                    "answer": "A Creative Master is a single, animated creative design with common elements that allows for multiple creative variations within that design. Creative variations can have different images and copy that appear based on specific dynamic triggers. An ad must include at least one creative master per ad size. There can be multiple creative masters per size that have different animations and numbers of frames. Below are two sets of creative masters in three ad sizes, made up of two frames each. Creative Master 1 is using one set of assets for the Female - Hiking - Sunny creative variation of this Trek brand ad. Creative Master 2 is another design, using assets for the Male- Running - Cloudy variation. A new Creative Master is required when elements such as animation, number of frames, position of elements, additional images, and image sizes differ from the original creative master. In Creative Master 2, an additional orange rectangle has been added behind the headline text, the product image is cropped, and the CTA button has a different design. It may also animate differently, such as having the headline text slide in instead of fading in. https://userguides.jivox.com/jivox-user-guide/What-is-a-Creative-Master"

A block of copy can be created as one text element for multiple lines or it can be split into one text element per line, for more control over the flow of copy. This would be determined when designing the creative master Copy within a single text element should generally have the same font size*, weight, line height, and colork*, The max and min lengths of copy should be tested in the creative master to ensure the text is flowing correctly and not overlapping other elements. If text is found to be overlapping, the code may need to be edited and may delay ad production. "

Imported footage files are identified in the AEPX and Jivox platform with the names as they appear in the Project panel in AE, where they can be modified. The files will retain their original names when collected into the project folder. Text layers should have unique layer names that map to column names in the asset source: copy1, copy2 Expressions should reference text layer index numbers instead of text layer names. Text layer names are changed when swapping source text dynamically, causing the reference in the expression to be invalid.
