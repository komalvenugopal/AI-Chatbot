When creating an ad, the different Rich Media ad units within the ad are all associated with distinct tags.

                "A Creative Master is a single, animated creative design with common elements that allows for multiple creative variations within that design. Creative variations can have different images and copy that appear based on specific dynamic triggers. An ad must include at least one creative master per ad size. There can be multiple creative masters per size that have different animations and numbers of frames. Below are two sets of creative masters in three ad sizes, made up of two frames each. Creative Master 1 is using one set of assets for the Female Hiking Sunny creative variation of this Trek brand ad. Creative Master 2 is another design, using assets for the Male- Running Cloudy variation. A new Creative Master is required when elements such as animation, number of frames, position of elements, additional images, and image sizes differ from the original creative master. In Creative Master 2, an additional orange rectangle has been added behind the headline text, the product image is cropped, and the CTA button has a different design. It may also animate differently, such as having the headline text slide in instead of fading in. https://userguides.jivox.com/jivox-user-guide/What-is-a-Creative-Master"

For example, if an ad has a Medium Rectangle and Leaderboard, each of these will have a distinct tag so they can be trafficked to ad slots for those units. Multiple tags can use the same ad unit, but a single tag is typically assigned to a single ad unit. If you are setting up Responsive Ads, multiple ad units of the same type (for example, Leaderboard) can be included in one tag. https://docs.jivox.com/jivox-documentation/creating-a-rich-media-ad-unit"

When creating an ad, the different Rich Media ad units within the ad are all associated with distinct tags.

There can be multiple creative masters per size that have different animations and numbers of frames. Below are two sets of creative masters in three ad sizes, made up of two frames each. Creative Master 1 is using one set of assets for the Female Hiking Sunny creative variation of this Trek brand ad. Creative Master 2 is another design, using assets for the Male- Running Cloudy variation. A new Creative Master is required when elements such as animation, number of frames, position of elements, additional images, and image sizes differ from the original creative master. In Creative Master 2, an additional orange rectangle has been added behind the headline text, the product image is cropped, and the CTA button has a different design.

When creating an ad, the different Rich Media ad units within the ad are all associated with distinct tags.

Multiple tags can use the same ad unit, but a single tag is typically assigned to a single ad unit. If you are setting up Responsive Ads, multiple ad units of the same type (for example, Leaderboard) can be included in one tag. https://docs.jivox.com/jivox-documentation/creating-a-rich-media-ad-unit"

When creating an ad, the different Rich Media ad units within the ad are all associated with distinct tags.

There can be multiple creative masters per size that have different animations and numbers of frames. Below are two sets of creative masters in three ad sizes, made up of two frames each. Creative Master 1 is using one set of assets for the Female Hiking Sunny creative variation of this Trek brand ad. Creative Master 2 is another design, using assets for the Male- Running Cloudy variation. A new Creative Master is required when elements such as animation, number of frames, position of elements, additional images, and image sizes differ from the original creative master. In Creative Master 2, an additional orange rectangle has been added behind the headline text, the product image is cropped, and the CTA button has a different design.

Creative Master 1 is using one set of assets for the Female Hiking Sunny creative variation of this Trek brand ad. Creative Master 2 is another design, using assets for the Male- Running Cloudy variation. A new Creative Master is required when elements such as animation, number of frames, position of elements, additional images, and image sizes differ from the original creative master. In Creative Master 2, an additional orange rectangle has been added behind the headline text, the product image is cropped, and the CTA button has a different design.
