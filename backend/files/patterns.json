When creating an ad, the different Rich Media ad units within the ad are all associated with distinct tags. For example, if an ad has a Medium Rectangle and Leaderboard, each of these will have a distinct tag so they can be trafficked to ad slots for those units. Multiple tags can use the same ad unit, but a single tag is typically assigned to a single ad unit. If you are setting up Responsive Ads, multiple ad units of the same type (for example, Leaderboard) can be included in one tag. https://docs.jivox.com/jivox-documentation/creating-a-rich-media-ad-unit"]
